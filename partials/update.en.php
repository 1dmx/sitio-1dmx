<p>Three months ago, this website was taken down thanks to the collaboration of the Mexican government and the United states. Today, the website has been reinstated, but no authority has yet taken responsibility for the action.</p>

<p>We find of utmost importance that Manuel Mondragon y Kalb, the commissioner for the agency that ordered the takedown, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, publicly state the reasons behind this act of censorship. After all, it's fundamental that the authorities explain why they started an investigation against those who document human rights violations.</p>

<p>How many more websites has the government took down when these don't align with the government's interests?</p>

<p>The restoration of 1dmx.org's website demonstrates that internet censorship does exist in Mexico, and most of all, that these acts can be stopped when we fight back. We call on those who have been censored to raise their voices and publish with the hashtag <strong>#CensuraMexta</strong> the websites and themes that have been taken down.</p>

<p>The silence of those responsible confirms one thing: any violation to our freedom of speech is –and will continue to be– an unconditionally repudiable act.</p>
